As I have prepared my weeks notice, I wanted to write down my thoughts on my experience working for Trulioo. After 2 years working for the company, I have learned a lot of things that I would like to self-reflect and touch upon, so let's get started!

### Identity Verification


### Trulioo
Trulioo is an online identity verification company. The company was founded in 2010, in Vancouver, BC. When I joined the company, we used to be 65 people in total and as of today, the number has grown to approximately 200 people. In these years, I was lucky enough to experience of what a high growth startup feels like, what are the major growing pains and what are the patterns that if adopted, can lead to high performing teams.
