            My name is Menelaos and this is my website. I have always been fascinated by computers. My curiosity about the underlying technologies
            made me experimenting with my keyboard at a young age.
            The research I did has shown me many different things you can do with computers
            and Programming became my favorite subject from young age. In June 2015, I graduated from University of Piraeus from the Information
            Technology department with First-Class grade (Honours). During the study I learned a lot about Computer Science including:
            Multithreading, OOAD, Graphics (Rasterization and OpenGL), Networking, Mobile Development, Image & Video Analysis, Machine Learning,
            Data Mining, Speech Recognition, Distributed Artificial Intelligence and so on. Every day I try to improve myself. I believe it is
            good to keep learning and researching new techniques that add value to projects. I have an unwavering motivation to bring innovation
            and quality to software products. I’ve assimilated a strong understanding of a software product’s development cycle, enjoy addressing
            new challenges and using new technologies, and am passionate about the development of software products that make a difference. At
            this moment I am pursuing my Master’s Degree at the University of New Brunswick under the supervising of Dr. Emmanuel
            Stefanakis and Dr. Yun Zhang.<br><br>
            <b>Software Engineering</b><br>
            As a Software Developer, I love to write my code in a structured, clear and concise way so I can organize it better. It eases the process
            of transferring a project to another team or revising an old project. Reusability is often on my mind while programming. I recognize
            patterns and look for appropriate opportunities to implement an application which can reuse code. I believe that double code means double
            maintenance. Maintenance costs time and time is money. Languages and Object Oriented Design are my speciality. I love to see complex
            data structures and to think about a way to make the data
            flow smoothly through a program which manipulates the data at several stages. It delights me to use encapsulation to create clean
            interfaces which allow us developers to put a complicated system behind a door and enable us to start gigantic processes at the press of a
            button. I think about optimization. What would make the system perform faster and would also be profitable to implement? This is a common
            question in my mind when I develop applications.
            <br><br>
            <b>Mobile Programming</b><br>
            In January of 2014 I was curious about mobile programming so in I transitioned to Android where I started with Android Studio 0.5, at the
            times when it used to be in BETA. I think that Android is the most promising and at the same time most challenging framework I have ever
            worked with. The rapidly increasing market and also to the tremendous amount of people that use Android devices, makes it a very promising
            Framework to develop at. After spending a lot of time with Android Framework, I feel very comfortable with it and especially with the
            Intellij IDE. Apart from computer related work, I enjoy to work in teams and to discuss projects in meetings. It brings variety to a
            working day. For example, the design of an application, a bit of planning and market potential of projects interest me. It also gives
            me a broader vision on the projects.
            <br><br>
            <b>Web Programming</b><br>
            In August of 2015 I started working at Hazus Canada, where I have been asked to implement a RESTful based application. The job includes
            much PHP, PHPUnit, HTML5 and Javascript. Lately I have been studying a lot about RESTful design & architecture and I firmly
            believe that you can build some really powerful and at the same time scalable  API's that are accessible to any programmer from any
            field. Technologies come and go but strong API's stay; that's what amazes me mostly about the RESTful applications.
            <br><br>
            <b>Some of the research fields that interest me:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>RESTful Architecture & Implementation</li>
                <li>Object Oriented Design & Structural Patterns</li>
                <li>Graph Theory and Optimization Problems</li>
                <li>Decision Mathematics</li>
                <li>Distributed Artificial Intelligence</li>
                <li>Semantic Geographic Information Systems</li>
                <li>Data Analysis - Data Mining - BIG Data</li>
