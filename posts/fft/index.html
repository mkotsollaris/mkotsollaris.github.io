                <h1>The Fast Fourier Transformation's applications in Image Processing</h1><br>
                Although there are many ways of blurring an image, such as computing a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)"> median or mean filter</a> by using a
                kernel image, most of them cannot undo the action and get the initial state of the image. We can
                achieve the image unblurring by using the 2D Fast Fourier Transformation(2D FFT). Although the FFT has
                much of a Mathematics background, we won't focus on its theory but instead we will focus on its
                application.
                <br>
                You can view the formulas of FFT and IFFT <a href="pictures/fft_ifft.png">here</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                You now might be wondering: Why do we need the FFT and the IFFT, what's their difference and how can we
                apply them to our applications. In order to answer these questions, let's examine the facts and the
                methodologies:
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Algorithm for Blurring an Image:</h3><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Compute the 2D FFT of an image, call this F</li>
                    <li>Compute the 2D FFT of the PSF image of the initial Image, call this H</li>
                    <li>G(i,j)=F(i,j)*H(i,j), where G the convolution of F with H</li>
                    <li>Compute the Inverse FFT of G</li>
                </ol>
                We should note the each camera has its own PSF image. We take it for granted that an images comes along
                with its PSF in this particular case, but if you are interested on how to extract an PSF image, you can
                read more in this <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/307631">Matlab
                thread</a> and on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function">Wikipedia</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, by computing the 2D FFT of an image, we get into the Frequency domain. The core
                methodologies are that
                by
                manipulating and running several algorithms on frequency domain, we can then use the inverse FFT to get
                back to the spatial domain and see the results. For instance, we can take advantage of the common
                knowledge
                expressed in the following picture, that the low frequencies (gathered in the middle of the Frequency
                Domain) are the pixels that contain the most significant information of the image and that the middle -
                high frequencies are noise, edges and corners of an image.
                <br>
                <br>
                But how about Unblurring (Restoring) an image? The technique it's pretty similar of blurring, but
                instead
                of convolving the images together, we divide them this time. The Algorithm is the following:
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Unblurring (Image Restoration) Algorithm:</h3><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Compute the 2D FFT of an image, call this F</li>
                    <li>Compute the 2D FFT of the PSF image of the initial Image, call this H</li>
                    <li>G(i,j)=F(i,j)/H(i,j), if (H(i,j)==0) then G(i,j)=0, where G the convolution of F with H.</li>
                    <li>Compute the Inverse FFT of G</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h3>The Notch Filter:</h3><br>
                Last but not least, if we take in consideration the fact that the FFT expresses an image as a sum of
                sine
                and cosine values, we can see that by simply removing the high frequency values (setting them to zero),
                we can remove the noise of an image. This is called the Notch filter. The Notch filter usually is
                applied
                for the structured noise removal, which come and think about it, it makes total sense since the
                structured
                noise will be periodical and it will be shown in the middle-high frequency on the frequency domain.
